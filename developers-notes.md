# Developer's Notes
This conversational action has not been designed as product to be widely used.
This is a sample app quickly designed in my head as I was helping my daughter
to learn arithmetic at elementary school.

If you are going to build a Google Assistant conversational action product,
feel free to use this as a reference.

# Sprints

Quickly develop each use case and validate with UX my daughter.

## Use Case #1 : MVP
1. User select an operation (addition), a level of difficulty.
2. Assistant propose an operation
3. User answer
4. if answer is correct, propose a new operation. If answer is incorrect, tell user to try again.
5. stop game when user says "stop"

## Todo

* Add Fullfilment to generate a random operation
* Add Fullfilment to validate operation
* Add Game loop
* Add Intent to stop game
